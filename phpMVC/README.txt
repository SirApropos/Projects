phpMVC is an MVC Framework for PHP.

Yeah, I know. They already have some out there, and they're a hell of a lot better than mine.

I just wanted to write one for the fun of it.

At the moment of writing this (Let's call it v0.0.1), there's minimal functionality at best.

Still, it's an interesting experience. Don't laugh too hard.
